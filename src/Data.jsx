My friend would point them in my direction, and they would spend their afternoons lounging on my comfortable cushions and mats, enjoying the beautiful view of the Red Sea. As time went on, I became more than just a sitting area. I started offering shisha, drinks, and snacks to my guests. My name became well-known among the locals, and I became a landmark in the city. I am proud to have made a name for myself in Sharm El-Sheikh, and I will continue to welcome guests from all over the world to experience the simplicity and tranquility of Farsha.",

My friend traveled across cities, villages, and deserts, collecting these antiques. Periodically, he brings a selection of these antiques and arranges them harmoniously... My goal is to bring joy to people in a simple manner. I remain happy when you feel the place as you would your drink or the food served to you.",

Additionally, there are tools, bottles, motorcycles, cars, paintings, and antique frames, each with its own story. Noteworthy is an antique door my friend bought, originally from a famous church. My fame stems from our friendly and polite service, diverse sessions, and the incorporation of beloved proverbs like Patience is the key to relief, reflecting my friend's vision for the future.",
